Write me a product design document (PDD) in markdown format. The product is a note taking app that allows simple formatting using markdown commands or a context menu that the user can access by typing a slash. The user will be able to share votes with others and mention them by typing @. The user can also add images or PDF files and the editor will show simple previews with an option to open a preview in full screen. The editor tags the content automatically but the user can script out delete the tags added. The tags are either projects, people, books, articles, or companies. Based on what the user notes down, an LLM tries to understand if the information are related to any existing resource (person, project, etc) and tags the notes accordingly. The tags are usually applied per block added to the notes. A block is either a paragraph, an image, a file or a list. If the LLM can’t connect if a block is  related to any existing resource, it tries to figure out if it should create a new resource. In any case, it shows the user visually when tabs are applied to a block or even new resources have been created and linked to the block. The user should decide if they accept these resource allocations or not. It is visually clear if a proposed resource on a block is accepted or linked manually or if no decisions had been made yet on a proposed resource linked to a block. Images and files are analysed by the LLM and a summary or a description is being created and stored in that particular block. The user can check and adjust these information if they see a need. Those files and images are also tagged based on the summary or description the LLM generated. In general when the user creates a new note they decide if it is about a meeting, something that is read, or just notes taken based on a thinking process. The user can then start tagging the note based on what they think this note-taking session will be about (e.g., meeting participants or the book being read). The LLM will the start propagating information based on previous interaction (e.g., recent learning about a person or a company, projects recently worked on with participants of a meeting). The app should reflect the intimate character of taking notes on paper as this feels like the most natural and secure way. “It’s a blank piece of paper and I will fill it with my thoughts, ideas, and actions.” That is how we would like users to feel with this app. All the input that comes from the LLM should feel like as you have your assistant ask the time with you which have you the exact file with all the information for the particular situation. We will start with a web app that supports PWA architecture which includes a local-first approach. That includes all work to be stored first in the browsers local storage before it is synchronised to a server. The PDD should only include the product design and not any web development frameworks or other technical aspects.
