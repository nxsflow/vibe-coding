# ADR 011: State Management Solution for Note-Taking App

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The note-taking application requires a robust and predictable state management solution to handle its complex state needs, particularly for real-time updates and offline capabilities. Managing the app’s state effectively ensures consistency across components and supports key features such as collaborative editing and offline functionality. The solution must meet the following requirements:

- **Real-Time Updates**: Handle state changes from collaborative editing (e.g., via Yjs and WebSockets) and other real-time features (e.g., notifications via GraphQL subscriptions).
- **Offline Capabilities**: Keep the app functional offline, with local state management and synchronization when connectivity is restored.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders in a data-intensive application.
- **Developer Experience**: Offer a maintainable and straightforward approach within React’s ecosystem, as the app is built with Next.js.

### Use Cases Requiring State Management

State management is distinct from offline capabilities (e.g., persisting notes in IndexedDB) and is essential for the following scenarios:

- **User Interface State**: Managing dynamic UI elements such as modals, toolbars, and theme toggles, which need to update instantly based on user interactions.
- **Session Data**: Tracking authentication status, user preferences, and temporary data like unsaved note edits, which must persist across components.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Reflecting live updates from other users in a shared note, ensuring the local state stays in sync with remote changes.
- **Offline Queue**: Maintaining a queue of changes made offline (e.g., new notes or edits), ready to sync with the server when the user reconnects.
- **Error and Notification Handling**: Displaying temporary messages or errors (e.g., “Saved successfully” or “Connection lost”) that update the UI without affecting persisted data.

These use cases demonstrate that state management handles dynamic, in-memory state and UI logic, while offline capabilities focus on persistent storage and synchronization.

## Decision

We will use **React Context with Hooks** as the state management solution for the note-taking app.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Simplicity**: Built into React, Context requires no external libraries and aligns with the team’s React expertise.
- **Efficient Updates**: Paired with hooks like `useReducer`, Context allows precise state updates, reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- **Offline Support**: Context can manage an in-memory offline queue and UI state, complementing IndexedDB for persistence.
- **Real-Time Integration**: Context updates seamlessly with WebSocket or GraphQL subscription events, keeping the UI current.
- **Modularity**: Multiple contexts can separate concerns (e.g., authentication, notes), improving code organization.

### Negative

- **Performance Risks**: Large or nested state trees may cause re-renders if not optimized with memoization.
- **Boilerplate**: Complex state logic with `useReducer` may introduce some repetitive code.
- **Limited Features**: Lacks advanced tools like Redux’s time-travel debugging, though these are not critical here.

## Options Considered

### 1. React Context with Hooks

- **Description**: A native React solution using Context and hooks like `useContext` and `useReducer`.
- **Pros**:
  - No external dependencies.
  - Fits naturally with React’s model.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires optimization for complex state.

### 2. Redux

- **Description**: A library with a centralized store, actions, and reducers for predictable state updates.
- **Pros**:
  - Robust debugging tools.
  - Ideal for large apps.
- **Cons**:
  - Heavy boilerplate.
  - Overkill for this scope.

### 3. MobX

- **Description**: A reactive library using observables for automatic state updates.
- **Pros**:
  - Minimal boilerplate.
  - Reactive simplicity.
- **Cons**:
  - Less predictable.
  - New learning curve.

### 4. Zustand

- **Description**: A lightweight library with a simple API for state management.
- **Pros**:
  - Easy to use.
  - Good performance.
- **Cons**:
  - Less structured.
  - Not as mature.

## Rationale

**React Context with Hooks** is the chosen solution because it balances simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility:

- **Simplicity**: As a native React feature, it avoids external dependencies and leverages existing team knowledge.
- **Efficiency**: With `useReducer` and memoization, Context manages complex state while optimizing performance.
- **Feature Support**: It handles real-time updates via event-driven updates and supports offline functionality by managing in-memory state alongside IndexedDB.
- **Scalability**: Separate contexts for different features ensure maintainability as the app grows.

Redux’s complexity, MobX’s paradigm shift, and Zustand’s lack of structure make them less suitable compared to Context’s native integration and adequacy for this app’s needs.

### Implementation Details

- **Global State**: Use Context for app-wide concerns like authentication and themes.
- **Feature-Specific State**: Define contexts for notes, collaboration, and UI elements.
- **Offline Queue**: Store offline actions in Context, syncing with IndexedDB and the backend on reconnection.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Update Context with WebSocket or GraphQL events for live collaboration.
