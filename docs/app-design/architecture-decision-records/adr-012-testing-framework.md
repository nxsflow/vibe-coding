# ADR 012: Testing Framework and Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Purpose

A comprehensive testing strategy is vital to ensure the note-taking app’s reliability and quality. This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) defines the testing frameworks and methodologies for unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) testing, ensuring high code quality and a dependable user experience. The strategy addresses the app’s complex features, such as real-time collaboration and offline capabilities, while maintaining efficiency and developer productivity.

## Context

The note-taking application requires a robust testing approach to meet the following objectives:

- **Unit Testing**: Validate individual components, functions, and modules in isolation to identify issues early.
- **Integration Testing**: Confirm that different parts of the app (e.g., frontend and backend) work together correctly.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete user workflows, including offline functionality and real-time features, to ensure the app performs as expected.
- **Code Quality**: Enforce high standards through automated testing and integration with continuous integration (CI) processes.
- **Tech Stack Alignment**: Leverage tools compatible with the app’s existing technologies (e.g., Next.js, AWS Amplify) and the team’s expertise.

## Decision

We will adopt the following testing frameworks and methodologies:

- **Unit Testing**: Use **Jest** with **React Testing Library** to test React components, utility functions, and state logic.
- **Integration Testing**: Employ **Jest** for backend and API testing, and **React Testing Library** for frontend-backend interactions.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Implement **Cypress** to simulate real user scenarios, including offline editing and real-time collaboration.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate all tests into a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run automatically on commits or scheduled intervals.

### Testing Breakdown

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on isolated units like utility functions, React components, and state management (e.g., Context providers).
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions such as API calls, GraphQL resolvers, and frontend data fetching.
- **E2E Tests**: Simulate full user journeys, such as creating a note offline, reconnecting, and syncing with the backend.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Improved Reliability**: Jest ensures individual units work correctly, while Cypress validates end-to-end flows.
- **User-Focused Quality**: React Testing Library tests components from a user’s perspective, enhancing UI dependability.
- **Thorough Validation**: Cypress covers complex features like offline persistence and real-time updates.
- **Automation**: CI integration catches issues early, reducing production bugs.
- **Efficiency**: Familiar tools like Jest and Cypress align with the team’s skills, speeding up test creation.

### Drawbacks

- **Initial Effort**: Setting up Cypress for offline and real-time testing may require extra configuration.
- **Performance**: E2E tests are slower than unit tests, though mitigated by running them selectively in CI.
- **Maintenance**: A growing test suite demands ongoing upkeep as the app evolves.

## Rationale

The selected frameworks and methodologies provide a balanced and effective testing strategy:

- **Jest with React Testing Library**: Jest is a widely adopted testing framework for React applications, offering fast and reliable unit tests. Paired with React Testing Library, it ensures components meet user expectations, aligning with the app’s emphasis on a quality UI.
- **Integration Testing Approach**: Jest handles backend and API tests efficiently, while React Testing Library verifies frontend-backend interactions, ensuring seamless data flow.
- **Cypress for E2E Testing**: Cypress is well-suited for simulating real-world user scenarios, such as offline note creation and real-time collaboration via WebSockets. Its ability to mock network conditions and handle asynchronous behavior makes it ideal for the app’s needs.
- **CI Pipeline**: Automating tests in CI ensures consistent quality checks and reduces manual overhead.

This combination balances thoroughness with practicality, leveraging the team’s familiarity with these tools to maintain a high standard of code quality and user experience.

## Implementation Details

- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for utility functions, React components, and state management logic.
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints, GraphQL resolvers, and frontend interactions like note retrieval.
- **E2E Tests**: Create scenarios such as:
  - Creating a note offline and syncing it upon reconnection.
  - Collaborating on a note in real time with multiple users.
- **CI Configuration**: Run unit and integration tests on every commit; execute E2E tests on a schedule or before releases.
