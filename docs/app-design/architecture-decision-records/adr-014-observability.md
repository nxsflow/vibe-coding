# ADR 014: Observability Solution

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The note-taking application requires an observability solution to ensure system health, performance, and a high-quality user experience. Observability is essential for detecting issues, understanding system behavior, and maintaining reliability. The solution must meet the following requirements:

- **Monitoring**: Track key metrics such as API response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
- **Logging**: Capture detailed logs for debugging and auditing.
- **Tracing**: Provide visibility into request flows across distributed services.
- **Alerting**: Enable proactive notifications for anomalies or performance issues.
- **Integration**: Work seamlessly with the app’s AWS-based infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Support the app’s growth without performance degradation.
- **Ease of Use**: Offer intuitive tools and dashboards for developers and operations teams.

Given the app’s reliance on AWS services, the solution should ideally integrate well with this ecosystem.

## Decision

We will adopt **AWS CloudWatch** as the primary observability solution, supplemented by **AWS X-Ray** for distributed tracing.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Native Integration**: CloudWatch and X-Ray integrate directly with AWS services (e.g., Lambda, API Gateway, ECS), simplifying setup and management.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: CloudWatch provides robust metrics, logs, and alerting capabilities to meet the app’s needs.
- **Distributed Tracing**: X-Ray offers detailed tracing of requests across services, aiding in debugging and performance optimization.
- **Scalability**: Both services scale automatically with the app’s usage, ensuring consistent observability.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: AWS’s pay-per-use model avoids upfront costs and fits the app’s budget.
- **Unified Platform**: Keeping observability within the AWS ecosystem reduces complexity.

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Team members unfamiliar with CloudWatch or X-Ray may need time to learn their features.
- **Limited Advanced Features**: Compared to some third-party tools, AWS solutions may lack certain advanced analytics or visualization options.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Heavy reliance on AWS services could complicate future migrations to other cloud providers.

## Options Considered

### 1. AWS CloudWatch with AWS X-Ray

- **Description**: AWS’s integrated tools for monitoring, logging, and tracing.
- **Pros**: Seamless AWS integration, comprehensive features, and scalability.
- **Cons**: Potential learning curve and limited advanced features.

### 2. Datadog

- **Description**: A third-party observability platform with monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities.
- **Pros**: Advanced analytics, user-friendly dashboards, and cross-cloud support.
- **Cons**: Higher costs and external dependency.

### 3. New Relic

- **Description**: A third-party solution focused on application performance monitoring (APM).
- **Pros**: Detailed performance insights and strong alerting.
- **Cons**: Expensive at scale and less integrated with AWS.

### 4. Open-Source Stack (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)

- **Description**: A custom observability stack built with open-source tools.
- **Pros**: Highly customizable and cost-effective.
- **Cons**: Requires significant setup and maintenance effort.

## Rationale

We selected **AWS CloudWatch with AWS X-Ray** for the following reasons:

- **Integration**: Both tools integrate natively with the app’s AWS infrastructure, reducing setup time and ensuring compatibility.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: CloudWatch effectively handles metrics, logs, and alarms, while X-Ray provides critical tracing for distributed systems.
- **Cost and Scalability**: The pay-per-use model and automatic scaling align with the app’s budget and growth needs.
- **Developer Experience**: AWS’s unified platform simplifies management, and the team’s existing AWS familiarity minimizes the learning curve.

Third-party options like Datadog and New Relic offer advanced features but come with higher costs and external dependencies, making them less suitable. An open-source stack, while flexible, demands significant resources for setup and maintenance, diverting focus from core development.

### Implementation Details

- **Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch to track key metrics (e.g., API latency, error rates) and create dashboards.
- **Logging**: Centralize logs from services like Lambda and ECS in CloudWatch Logs for analysis.
- **Tracing**: Instrument the app with X-Ray to trace requests and identify bottlenecks.
- **Alerting**: Set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify the team of issues via SNS or Slack integrations.
