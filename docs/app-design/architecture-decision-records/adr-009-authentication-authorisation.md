# ADR 009: Choose Authentication and Authorization Solution for Note-Taking App

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The note-taking application requires a secure and efficient solution for user authentication and authorization. The solution must meet the following key requirements:

- **Authentication**: Users need to log in securely using common methods such as email/password and social logins (e.g., Google, Apple).
- **Authorization**: The app must control access to notes, allowing users to maintain private notes and share them with others for collaboration.
- **Integration**: The solution should integrate seamlessly with the app’s existing AWS Amplify backend and Next.js frontend.
- **Security**: Authentication tokens must be managed securely, particularly to support offline access as outlined in prior architectural decisions (e.g., ADR 006).
- **User Experience**: The authentication process should be intuitive, offering features like "remember me" or biometric authentication on supported devices.

Since the app leverages the AWS ecosystem, the solution should ideally utilize AWS services to maintain consistency and simplify management.

## Decision

We will implement **AWS Cognito** as the authentication and authorization solution for the note-taking app.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Seamless Integration**: Cognito works natively with AWS Amplify, streamlining setup and management within the existing backend infrastructure.
- **Scalability and Security**: As a managed service, Cognito provides user pools, identity pools, and security features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and token refresh, reducing operational overhead.
- **Social Login Support**: Cognito’s federated identity feature enables easy integration with social identity providers (e.g., Google, Apple).
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Cognito’s identity pools support role-based access via AWS IAM, while note-specific permissions can be managed in DynamoDB.
- **Offline Support**: Cognito’s token refresh mechanisms can be configured to handle extended offline periods, aligning with offline access requirements.

### Negative

- **Configuration Complexity**: Advanced use cases, such as highly customized authentication flows, may require intricate configuration.
- **AWS Dependency**: Adopting Cognito further ties the application to the AWS ecosystem, which could complicate future migrations.
- **Custom Logic Required**: Fine-grained authorization (e.g., per-note access control) will necessitate additional application-level logic beyond Cognito’s capabilities.

## Options Considered

Several alternatives were evaluated based on the app’s requirements:

### 1. **AWS Cognito**

- _Description_: A managed AWS service offering user pools for authentication, identity pools for authorization, and federated identity support.
- _Pros_: Tight integration with AWS Amplify, scalability, robust security features, and social login support.
- _Cons_: Complex configuration for advanced scenarios; increases reliance on AWS.

### 2. **Auth0**

- _Description_: A third-party identity platform known for flexibility and customization.
- _Pros_: Highly customizable and simpler for complex authentication flows.
- _Cons_: External service, diverging from the app’s AWS-centric approach.

### 3. **Firebase Authentication**

- _Description_: Google’s managed authentication service with features similar to Cognito.
- _Pros_: Rich feature set and ease of use.
- _Cons_: Introduces another cloud provider, adding complexity to the tech stack.

### 4. **Custom Solution (e.g., Passport.js)**

- _Description_: A bespoke authentication system built from scratch.
- _Pros_: Offers maximum flexibility and control.
- _Cons_: Significant development and maintenance effort; increased security risks.

## Rationale

AWS Cognito was chosen as the optimal solution for the note-taking app due to its alignment with the app’s requirements and existing infrastructure:

- **Authentication**: Cognito’s user pools enable secure login via email/password and social providers, fulfilling the need for multiple authentication methods.
- **Authorization**: Identity pools allow role-based access through IAM roles, while per-note permissions can be stored and managed in DynamoDB for granular control.
- **Integration**: Cognito integrates directly with AWS Amplify, ensuring compatibility with the backend and simplifying frontend development via Amplify’s Auth module.
- **Security**: Built-in features like MFA and token refresh enhance security, and Cognito’s token management supports offline access requirements.
- **User Experience**: The Amplify Auth module facilitates a smooth login experience, with options like "remember me" and potential biometric integration.

While Auth0 offers greater flexibility, it introduces an external dependency that conflicts with the AWS-focused architecture. Firebase Authentication, though capable, would require integrating another cloud provider, which is undesirable. A custom solution was ruled out due to its high development cost and security risks. Cognito strikes the best balance of functionality, security, and integration, making it the most suitable choice.

### Implementation Details

- **Authentication**: Use Cognito user pools for email/password and social logins.
- **Authorization**: Leverage identity pools for IAM-based roles and store note-specific permissions in DynamoDB.
- **Offline Access**: Implement token refresh logic to support long offline periods, with a sync mechanism to verify permissions upon reconnection.
- **Frontend**: Utilize AWS Amplify’s Auth module in the Next.js frontend for a seamless user experience.
