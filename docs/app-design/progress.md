# Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup

### Step 1: Initialize the Next.js Project (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Created a new Next.js project using `create-next-app@latest`
- Used the following configuration options:
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - ESLint for code quality
  - App Router for routing
  - src directory structure for better organization
  - "@/\*" import alias for cleaner imports

**Test Results:**

- Successfully ran the development server with `npm run dev`
- Verified that the default Next.js welcome page loads without errors at `http://localhost:3000`

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 2: Install Core Dependencies

**Notes for Developers:**

- The project uses Next.js 15, which includes significant performance improvements and updated features compared to previous versions
- The App Router architecture provides enhanced routing capabilities and supports React Server Components
- The project structure follows Next.js best practices with the src directory pattern for better organization

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Installed the following packages:
  - Tiptap packages for the editor: `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`
  - Yjs packages for real-time collaboration: `yjs`, `y-prosemirror`
  - AWS packages for backend integration: `aws-amplify`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
  - Utilities: `uuid`

**Test Results:**

- Verified all dependencies were added correctly in `package.json`
- Successfully ran the development server with `npm run dev`
- Confirmed the app loads without errors at `http://localhost:3001`

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 3: Initialize AWS Amplify Gen 2

**Notes for Developers:**

- Tiptap (v2.11.5) is based on ProseMirror and provides a rich text editing experience with extensible functionality
- Yjs (v13.6.24) and y-prosemirror (v1.2.17) enable real-time collaboration capabilities
- AWS Amplify (v6.13.5) serves as the backend framework for authentication, storage, and API functionality

### Step 3: Initialize AWS Amplify Gen 2 (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Installed AWS Amplify Gen 2 dependencies:
  - `@aws-amplify/backend` for defining backend resources
  - `@aws-amplify/backend-cli` for CLI commands
- Initialized the Amplify project using `npx create-amplify@latest`
- Created baseline Amplify configuration:
  - Generated `amplify/backend.ts` as the main backend definition
  - Generated default auth configuration with email login
  - Generated default data resource with a Todo model schema

**Test Results:**

- Verified the Amplify directory structure was created correctly
- Confirmed the auth and data resources were properly generated
- Sandbox deployment requires AWS credentials which would be set up in a real environment

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 4: Define Authentication with AWS Cognito

**Notes for Developers:**

- AWS Amplify Gen 2 uses a TypeScript-first approach for defining backend resources
- The generated auth resource is configured with email-based login by default
- The data resource includes a simple Todo model as a starting point
- The backend definition in `backend.ts` imports and combines all resources

### Step 4: Define Authentication with AWS Cognito (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Enhanced the authentication configuration in `amplify/auth/resource.ts`:
  - Configured email-based login as the primary authentication method
  - Disabled phone and username login options for clarity
  - Added multi-factor authentication (MFA) support with TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
  - Set MFA as optional to provide users with enhanced security without making it mandatory

**Test Results:**

- Validated the TypeScript configuration for auth with no linting errors
- Attempted to test with Amplify sandbox, but AWS credentials would be required in a real environment
- In a production environment, this would generate a Cognito User Pool with the specified authentication options

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 5: Define GraphQL API with AWS AppSync

**Notes for Developers:**

- The MFA configuration uses TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password), requiring users to use an authenticator app
- MFA is set as optional, allowing users to choose whether to enable the additional security layer
- Email verification is automatically enabled when using email-based login
- In a production environment, testing would involve using the AWS Cognito console to verify the user pool configuration

### Step 5: Define GraphQL API with AWS AppSync (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Enhanced the data model in `amplify/data/resource.ts` to define the schema for the note-taking application
- Implemented the following models using a domain-driven design approach:
  - `Note`: Core entity storing title, content (as JSON), type, and relationships to resources
  - Domain-specific resource models:
    - `Person`: For people mentioned in notes
    - `Project`: For projects referenced in notes
    - `Company`: For companies discussed in notes
    - `Book`: For book references with title, authors, and year
    - `Article`: For article references with title, authors, and URL
  - Junction models for block-level associations:
    - `PersonNote`: Links specific blocks to people
    - `ProjectNote`: Links specific blocks to projects
    - `CompanyNote`: Links specific blocks to companies
  - `Resource`: For file attachments (PDFs, images) with block-level references and summaries
  - `NoteVersion`: For tracking version history of notes with version numbers
- Applied owner-based authorization for all models to ensure data security
- Added secondary indexes with sort keys to optimize queries by type, creation date, and update date
- Defined clear relationships between entities using hasMany, hasOne, and belongsTo patterns

**Test Results:**

- Validated the data schema compiles without linting errors
- In a production environment, this would generate the necessary DynamoDB tables and AppSync resolvers

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 6: Set Up File Storage with AWS S3

**Notes for Developers:**

- Content is stored as JSON rather than string, allowing for structured block data
- Block-level references are implemented through junction tables with blockId fields
- Each domain-specific entity (Person, Project, etc.) has its own model and junction table
- Secondary indexes include sort keys for efficient time-based queries
- Resource model handles file attachments with type differentiation (PDF vs Image)
- Note versions track the evolution of content over time with sequential version numbers
- AWS Amplify automatically handles the id, createdAt, and updatedAt fields
- All models use owner-based authorization for data security
- Collaboration capabilities have been deferred to a later implementation phase

### Step 6: Set Up File Storage with AWS S3 (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Created the storage resource directory `amplify/storage/`
- Implemented the storage configuration in `amplify/storage/resource.ts`:
  - Configured S3 storage for the application with a bucket named 'NoteAppStorage'
  - Set up owner-based access patterns using the {entity_id} token for enhanced security:
    - Created separate paths for different storage purposes:
      - `notes/{entity_id}/*` for note-related files
      - `resources/{entity_id}/*` for general user resources
      - `shared/{entity_id}/*` for selectively shared resources
    - Applied granular access controls:
      - Owners have full read/write/delete permissions on their own files
      - For shared resources, authenticated users have read-only access to owner-shared content
- Updated the main backend definition in `amplify/backend.ts` to include the storage resource
- Verified the AWS Amplify storage package is installed and available

**Test Results:**

- Validated the storage configuration compiles without linting errors
- Configuration is ready for sandbox deployment when AWS credentials are available
- In a production environment, this would create an S3 bucket with the specified access controls

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 7: Integrate Amplify Auth in the Frontend

**Notes for Developers:**

- The storage configuration uses owner-based access patterns with the {entity_id} token
- The {entity_id} token is automatically replaced with the user's unique identifier during operations
- Files are organized into logical paths:
  - `/notes/{entity_id}/*` for files directly associated with notes
  - `/resources/{entity_id}/*` for general user resources
  - `/shared/{entity_id}/*` for resources that can be read by other authenticated users
- Each user can only access their own files, with the exception of shared resources
- When uploading files, make sure to prefix the key with the appropriate path (notes/, resources/, shared/)
- This approach maintains strict data isolation while still enabling sharing when needed
