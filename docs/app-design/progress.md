# Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup

### Step 1: Initialize the Next.js Project (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Created a new Next.js project using `create-next-app@latest`
- Used the following configuration options:
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - ESLint for code quality
  - App Router for routing
  - src directory structure for better organization
  - "@/\*" import alias for cleaner imports

**Test Results:**

- Successfully ran the development server with `npm run dev`
- Verified that the default Next.js welcome page loads without errors at `http://localhost:3000`

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 2: Install Core Dependencies

**Notes for Developers:**

- The project uses Next.js 15, which includes significant performance improvements and updated features compared to previous versions
- The App Router architecture provides enhanced routing capabilities and supports React Server Components
- The project structure follows Next.js best practices with the src directory pattern for better organization

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Installed the following packages:
  - Tiptap packages for the editor: `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`
  - Yjs packages for real-time collaboration: `yjs`, `y-prosemirror`
  - AWS packages for backend integration: `aws-amplify`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
  - Utilities: `uuid`

**Test Results:**

- Verified all dependencies were added correctly in `package.json`
- Successfully ran the development server with `npm run dev`
- Confirmed the app loads without errors at `http://localhost:3001`

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 3: Initialize AWS Amplify Gen 2

**Notes for Developers:**

- Tiptap (v2.11.5) is based on ProseMirror and provides a rich text editing experience with extensible functionality
- Yjs (v13.6.24) and y-prosemirror (v1.2.17) enable real-time collaboration capabilities
- AWS Amplify (v6.13.5) serves as the backend framework for authentication, storage, and API functionality

### Step 3: Initialize AWS Amplify Gen 2 (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Installed AWS Amplify Gen 2 dependencies:
  - `@aws-amplify/backend` for defining backend resources
  - `@aws-amplify/backend-cli` for CLI commands
- Initialized the Amplify project using `npx create-amplify@latest`
- Created baseline Amplify configuration:
  - Generated `amplify/backend.ts` as the main backend definition
  - Generated default auth configuration with email login
  - Generated default data resource with a Todo model schema

**Test Results:**

- Verified the Amplify directory structure was created correctly
- Confirmed the auth and data resources were properly generated
- Sandbox deployment requires AWS credentials which would be set up in a real environment

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 4: Define Authentication with AWS Cognito

**Notes for Developers:**

- AWS Amplify Gen 2 uses a TypeScript-first approach for defining backend resources
- The generated auth resource is configured with email-based login by default
- The data resource includes a simple Todo model as a starting point
- The backend definition in `backend.ts` imports and combines all resources

### Step 4: Define Authentication with AWS Cognito (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Enhanced the authentication configuration in `amplify/auth/resource.ts`:
  - Configured email-based login as the primary authentication method
  - Disabled phone and username login options for clarity
  - Added multi-factor authentication (MFA) support with TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
  - Set MFA as optional to provide users with enhanced security without making it mandatory

**Test Results:**

- Validated the TypeScript configuration for auth with no linting errors
- Attempted to test with Amplify sandbox, but AWS credentials would be required in a real environment
- In a production environment, this would generate a Cognito User Pool with the specified authentication options

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 5: Define GraphQL API with AWS AppSync

**Notes for Developers:**

- The MFA configuration uses TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password), requiring users to use an authenticator app
- MFA is set as optional, allowing users to choose whether to enable the additional security layer
- Email verification is automatically enabled when using email-based login
- In a production environment, testing would involve using the AWS Cognito console to verify the user pool configuration
