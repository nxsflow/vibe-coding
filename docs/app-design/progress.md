# Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup

### Step 1: Initialize the Next.js Project (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Created a new Next.js project using `create-next-app@latest`
- Used the following configuration options:
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - ESLint for code quality
  - App Router for routing
  - src directory structure for better organization
  - "@/\*" import alias for cleaner imports

**Test Results:**

- Successfully ran the development server with `npm run dev`
- Verified that the default Next.js welcome page loads without errors at `http://localhost:3000`

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 2: Install Core Dependencies

**Notes for Developers:**

- The project uses Next.js 15, which includes significant performance improvements and updated features compared to previous versions
- The App Router architecture provides enhanced routing capabilities and supports React Server Components
- The project structure follows Next.js best practices with the src directory pattern for better organization

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-03-19

**Actions Taken:**

- Installed the following packages:
  - Tiptap packages for the editor: `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`
  - Yjs packages for real-time collaboration: `yjs`, `y-prosemirror`
  - AWS packages for backend integration: `aws-amplify`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
  - Utilities: `uuid`

**Test Results:**

- Verified all dependencies were added correctly in `package.json`
- Successfully ran the development server with `npm run dev`
- Confirmed the app loads without errors at `http://localhost:3001`

**Next Step:**

- Proceed to Step 3: Initialize AWS Amplify Gen 2

**Notes for Developers:**

- Tiptap (v2.11.5) is based on ProseMirror and provides a rich text editing experience with extensible functionality
- Yjs (v13.6.24) and y-prosemirror (v1.2.17) enable real-time collaboration capabilities
- AWS Amplify (v6.13.5) serves as the backend framework for authentication, storage, and API functionality
