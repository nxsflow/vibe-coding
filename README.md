# My Vibe Coding Adventure: Building a Note-Taking App with AI

Read my [blog article](https://nexflow.it/de-DE/blog/vibe-coding-adventure) on my vibe coding experience.

Use [this prompt example as a starting point to build your Product Design Document](docs/prompts-vibe-coding/prompt-pdd.txt).

This repository shows you the result of implementing Phase 1 and 4 of the [implementation plan](docs/app-design/implementation-plan.md). I removed Phase 2 and 3 to make it easier for you to test it locally as such phases rely on AWS Amplify.

## Run this project locally

1. Clone the repo locally
2. Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in your project folder to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` and open `localhost:3000` in your browser to see it live.

The project runs React 19 and some dependencies do not support React 19 yet, so that's why you need to add the legacy peer dependencies.
