# Leverage AWS Ecosystem Integration

Utilize the designated AWS services consistently: manage the backend with AWS Amplify, authenticate users via AWS Cognito, expose the GraphQL API through AWS AppSync, store data in AWS DynamoDB, handle file storage with AWS S3, and enable real-time collaboration using a custom WebSocket server on AWS. Ensure all generated code adheres to these service selections for seamless integration.
